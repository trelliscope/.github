## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the Trelliscope GitHub organization!

https://trelliscope.org

Trelliscope is an open-source tool for creating apps for exploring large data frames of visualizations. It currently consists of a JavaScript library [trelliscopejs-lib](https://github.com/trelliscope/trelliscopejs-lib) and an R interface, [trelliscope](https://github.com/trelliscope/trelliscope). A [Python package](https://github.com/trelliscope/trelliscope-py) is in the works and many other ideas are on the roadmap.
